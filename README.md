# Project1

This project was created rapidly, within less than a week, for a class project.

This public repository is for the administration of Take Me Away, Project-One. This application is designed to make traveling easier by providing weather data and Points of Interest for cities searched. If provided more time, the user will be able to add their favorite cities to their very own Bucket List.

For each city that is searched, we use three different APIâ€™s to gather information on the specific location and relay it back to the user. The Open Cage Geocoder  API is used to get the exact location of the search (latitude and longitude coordinates), while the Amadeus API renders data for cool Points of Interest in that city. Lastly, the Open Weather API returns current weather data for city that is searched.

To visit the main website use the following link, https://takemeaway01.github.io/Project1/

For the reason that when the Amadeus API key expires,  you will need to generate a new token that lasts for only 30 minutes.  In order to generate a new token, you must also create an account to generate a Client Key and Secret Key. Replace the old token in the Javascript code with the new token to Take You Away.  


Files that include our work are within the assets folder.

Creators of this application are: Nicholas Ready, Giovanna Roman, & Saikal Asylbekova
